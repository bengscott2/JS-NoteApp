# JS Note List Challenge

### Description
This single page web app once completed will give you the ability to access a webpage to store your notes. This will have it's own testing framework as well it will store all notes and independent note objects.

### How to run the testing framework
In your terminal type `open RunSpec.html`. Then once it opens in your browser open up your developer tools and click on the `console` tab. There you will see the tests print out and if any fail they will throw an error.

 ### Current Functionality
 *This will be updated as the project evolves*

 - Currently the testing framework exists with the ability to mock objects.

 - Two models exists. One model for individual notes and one to the collection of notes.
